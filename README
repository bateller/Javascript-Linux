A Javascript x86 emulator written in Coffeescript.

Some of the code based on:
	JPC: A x86 PC Hardware Emulator for a pure Java Virtual Machine
	Release Version 2.0

	A project from the Physics Dept, The University of Oxford

	Copyright (C) 2007-2009 Isis Innovation Limited

Build the Javascript source, use make (Coffeescript and coffeelint both need to be installed on your computer) and open index.html in the browser.
If you want to have the minified version of the source, you can call make minify, however the minified jar from google will need to be downloaded seperately. The index.html file right now doesnt use the minified version!

Please note this is work in progress, and right now it would not work at all :).

If you want to run the emulator, there is debug information written into the console log, right now this cant be disabled. Right now the javascript sources will need to be build directly from the coffeescript source files, they arent in this repo.

Running tests:
To run the tests included with the emulator you will need to download the QUnit files seperatly, and place them in the src/ directory. Without these files the emulator will not run at all.
After that, open test.html in a browser (Not file the file:// protocol, the test will fail!)
